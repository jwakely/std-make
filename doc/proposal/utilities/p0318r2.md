# Introduction


This paper proposes to introduce two new transformation type traits `unwrap_reference` and `unwrap_ref_decay` associated to the type deduction when `reference_wrapper<T>` can be used to mean `T&`. 

# Motivation

There are some places in the standard where we can find wording such as

*Returns*: `pair<V1, V2>(std::forward<T1>(x), std::forward<T2>(y));` where `V1` and `V2` are determined as follows: Let `Ui` be `decay_t<Ti>` for each `Ti`. Then each `Vi` is `X&` if `Ui` equals `reference_wrapper<X>`, otherwise `Vi` is `Ui`. 

The intent is hard to catch and should be described  only once as it is the case of `DECAY_COPY`, e.g. `UNWRAP_REF_DECAY`.

In addition the author believes that using these kind of macros when we are able to define them using  functions or traits makes the standard less clear.


Compare the previous wording to

*Returns*: `pair<unwrap_ref_decay_t<T1>, unwrap_ref_decay_t<T2>>(std::forward<T1>(x), std::forward<T2>(y));` 

If the traits are not adopted, the author suggest to use `UNWRAP_REF_DECAY  (T)` and define it only once on the standard. 

This trait can already be used in the following cases

* [pair.spec] p8
* [tuple.creation] p2,3
* Concurrent TS [P0159R0] `make_ready_future`

 
To the knowledge of the author `decay_unwrap` is used already in [HPX], and in [Boost.Thread] as `deduced_type`.

The author plans to use it also in other factory proposals as the ongoing [P0338R0] and [P0319R0].


# Proposal

We propose to: 

* add an `unwrap_reference` type trait that unwraps a `reference_wrapper`;
* add a `unwrap_ref_decay` type trait that decay and then unwraps if wrapped.

# Design rationale

## `unwrap_reference` type trait

Having a way to wrap a reference with `reference_wrapper` needs a way to unwrap it.

`unwrap_ref_decay` can be defined in function of `decay` and a `unwrap_reference`.

It could be seen as an implementation detail, but seems useful.


## `unwrap_ref_decay` type trait

`unwrap_ref_decay` can be considered as an implementation detail as it is equivalent to `unwrap_reference<decay_t<T>>`. However, the author find that it makes the wording much simpler.


# Impact on the standard

These changes are entirely based on library extensions and do not require any language features beyond what is available in C++17. 


# Proposed wording

This wording is relative to [N4727].

## General utilities library

**20.9 Header `<functional>` synopsis**

*Change [function.objects], header <functional> synopsis, after reference_wrapper*

```c++
namespace std {
    [...]

    template <class T>
      struct unwrap_reference;

    template <class T>
      struct unwrap_ref_decay : unwrap_reference<decay_t<T>> {}

    template <class T>
      using unwrap_ref_decay_t = typename unwrap_ref_decay<T>::type;

    [...]
}
```

*Add a subsection section*

Transformation Type trait `unwrap_reference` [function.objects.unwrapref]

```c++
template <class T>
struct unwrap_reference;
```

The member typedef `type` of `unwrap_reference <T>` shall equal `X&` if `T` equals `reference_wrapper<X>`, `T` otherwise. 


*23.4.3  Specialized algorithms [pairs.spec]*

Replace

9 *Returns*: `pair<V1, V2>(std::forward<T1>(x), std::forward<T2>(y));` where `V1` and `V2` are determined as follows: Let `Ui` be `decay_t<Ti>` for each `Ti`. Then each `Vi` is `X&` if `Ui` equals `reference_wrapper<X>`, otherwise `Vi` is `Ui`.

by

Let  `Vi` is `unwrap_ref_decay_t <Ti>`.

9 *Returns*: `pair<V1, V2>(std::forward<T1>(x), std::forward<T2>(y));`.
 
*23.5.3.4 Tuple creation functions [tuple.creation]*

Replace

2 The pack `VTypes` is defined as follows. Let `Ui` be `decay_t<Ti>` for each `Ti` in `TTypes`. If `Ui` is a specialization of `reference_wrapper`, then `Vi` in `VTypes` is `Ui::type&`, otherwise `Vi` is `Ui`.

by 

2 The pack `VTypes` is defined as if `VTypes...` were `unwrap_ref_decay_t<TTypes>...`, that is, for each `Ti` in `TTypes` then `Vi` in `VTypes` is `unwrap_ref_decay_t<Ti>`. 

   
# Implementability

The implementation is really simple

```c++
template <class T>
struct unwrap_reference { using type = T; }
template <class T>
struct unwrap_reference<reference_wrapper<T>> { using type = T&; }

template <class T>
struct unwrap_ref_decay : unwrap_reference<decay_t<T>> {}

template <class T>
using unwrap_ref_decay_t = typename unwrap_ref_decay<T>::type;
```

# Open question

## Do we want this to be duplicated on the Fundamental TS V3?

We have some uses of these traits to simplify the wording of the `not_fn` function object in the Fundamental Ts [N4600] and maybe also the `bind_front` function object [P0356R2].

If desired the changes in `<functional>` could be duplicated to `<experimental/functional>`.

## Do we want the Concurrent Ts to depend on the Fundamental TS?

We have some uses of these traits to simplify the wording of the `make_ready_function` factory the Concurrent Ts.

If the dependency is worth, additional changes could be applied to [P0159R0].

*2.10 Function template make_ready_future [futures.make_ready_future]*

```c++ 
template <class T>
future<V> make_ready_future(T&& value);

future<void> make_ready_future();
```

Replace 

3 Let `U` be `decay_t<T>`. Then `V` is `X&` if `U` equals `reference_wrapper<X>`, otherwise `V` is `U`.

by 

3 Let `U` be `unwrap_ref_decay_t<T>`. 



# Acknowledgements 

Thanks to Agustín Bergé K-ballo who show me that [HPX] uses these traits already.

Special thanks and recognition goes to Technical Center of Nokia - Lannion for supporting in part the production of this proposal.

# History

## Changes since p0318r0

Take in account the LEWG feedback from JAX 2017

* Maintain `unwrap_reference`
* Rename `decay_unwrap` to `unwrap_ref_decay`.
* Update the wording and reduce the change to the IS C++20 and left the possibility to update the TS [N4600] so that other TS's can profit of those traits as e.g. the Concurrent Ts V2 [P0159R0].
* Added other ongoing proposals that could take advantage of this proposal.
* Changed the open points.
